# A/B Test Analysis Project

Hey there! I'm Ricardo Cortes, and I'm excited to share with you a project where I delved into the results of an A/B test conducted by our e-commerce website.

## Project Overview
I took on the challenge of understanding the impact of a new web page developed by our company. The primary objective was to boost the conversion rate, essentially increasing the number of users who decide to make a purchase.

## Goals
As I navigate through the project, my mission is to provide insights that will help our company make an informed decision. Should we implement the new page, stick with the old one, or is there merit in extending the experiment duration? Let's find out together!

## How to Navigate
Code: Check out the notebook in the /analysis directory for the detailed code implementation.
Dataset: Head over to /dataset for the CSV used in this project.
Feel free to explore the project, contribute your thoughts, or share feedback.
